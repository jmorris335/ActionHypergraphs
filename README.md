# ActionHypergraphs
This repository enables usage of hypergraphs to define sand execute system models. **It is not a rigorous data storage solution. Do not use this as a database.** Note that this repo is under active development (no official release yet), therefore changes may occur rapidly. Fork the repository to create a more stable base if you want to try it. 

## Getting started
Check out the `demos` directory to see how this can be used with some intuitive models.

## Introduction
Hypergraphs are normal graphs but without the constraint that edges must only link between two nodes. Because of this expanded generality, hypergraphs can be used to model more complex relationships. For instance, the relationship `A + B = C` is a multinodal relationship between three nodes, A, B, and C. You can think of all three nodes being linked by a 2D hyperedge, so that to move along that hyperedge you need at least two of three nodes.
